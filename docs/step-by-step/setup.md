# Setup
In this section we will setup zagreus (if you haven't already) and create a zagreus template project. This tutorial assumes that you have a basic familiarity with the terminal / shell on your operating system.

## Setup zagreus
To install zagreus, you need to download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/mariokaufmann/zagreus/releases/latest). Unzip the archive to a location of your choosing. We recommend to add that location to the `PATH` environment variable on your system.

## Create zagreus template
A zagreus template in its simplest form is just an HTML file that includes a Javascript file called the  _zagreus runtime_. By linking that file the template will automatically announce itself to the server and from then on it can be manipulated through zagreus.
