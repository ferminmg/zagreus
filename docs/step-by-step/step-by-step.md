# Step-by step introduction

In this introduction we will build up a template step by step while trying to touch on all the most important aspects of
zagreus. We will design a new template, use the zagreus generator to convert it into a zagreus template, add dynamic
text, styling and animations to it. From there we go over how to control template playout, i.e. how to set dynamic text,
add styling dynamically and play animations.

## End result

We will build a score board graphic that can be animated in and out and has dynamic texts for displaying the teams, the
time and the score.
